To setup this project, you need to clone this repository.

1. Clone using SSH or HTTPS

   `git clone git@github.com:0foxy0/dice-bot.git`

The package manager I used for this project, and use generally, is `yarn`. You may use `npm` if you wish however if you run into any issues with installing dependencies or building, consider switching to `yarn`.

2. `cd` into the cloned project, and then install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
